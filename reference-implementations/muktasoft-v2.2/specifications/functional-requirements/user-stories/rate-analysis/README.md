# Rate Analysis

Rate analysis in Public Works Departments (PWD) involves the examination and calculation of rates for various construction activities or works. It is a systematic process carried out to determine the cost of executing a particular work item per unit quantity. Rate analysis typically involves breaking down the cost components associated with a construction activity, including materials, labor, machinery, contractor's profit, overhead costs, and miscellaneous expenses.
