# Detailed MB

The measurement book is a most important record. It is the basis of all accounts of quantities of work done, purchase made and it must contain such a complete record of facts as to be conclusive evidence in court of law.

It is the basis of all accounts of quantities whether of works done by Contractors or by laborers employed departmentally, or materials received. It is so written the transactions are readily traceable.
