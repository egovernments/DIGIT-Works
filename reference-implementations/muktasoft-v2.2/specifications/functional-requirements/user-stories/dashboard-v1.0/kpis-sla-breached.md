# KPIs: SLA Breached

## **SLA Breached**

### **Estimate Approval**

1. Number of estimates that are created in the selected time period but have breached their SLA is respective workflow statuses.
2. Ex. Estimate created on Jan 15 (timeline selected is Jan 12-18), SLA is 5 days for one particular state. From Jan 21 on-wards till date this will be counted as SLA breach.
3. Parallel there could be other estimates in other workflow statuses too which have their respective SLA breaches.
4. All these will be accumulated to form SLA breach of Estimates.
5. If estimate is moved to next workflow state, this count will go down until the breach happens again.
6. All SLA breaches below KPIs follow same Logic.
