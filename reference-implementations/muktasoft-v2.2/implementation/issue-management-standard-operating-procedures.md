# Issue Management - Standard Operating Procedures

## **Process Flow**

Post-pilot implementation of MUKTA V1 in 2 ULBs (Jatni and Dhenkanal), a helpdesk will be set up by HUDD for the resolution of the queries by ULB employees and CBOs. This document has been put in place as a ready reckoner to ensure the smooth resolution of the queries without any delays.

1. An operations and maintenance help desk would be set up by HUDD and the nominated staff would be trained extensively on all the features of the MUKTA app and tackling related queries.
2. As and when the users face an issue, they would call the said O\&M helpdesk for assistance. The reported issues would be categorized into functional or technical or bugs and enhancements and logged into a ticketing tool.
3. In case the help desk staff is unable to resolve the issue from their end, all functional issues would be escalated to the Master Trainers.
4. Technical issues would be escalated to the Technical Team of HUDD.
5. All bugs and enhancements would be forwarded to the eGov team.
6. The technical issues related to the infrastructure provided by HUDD will be referred to the technical team at HUDD and other technical issues with respect to the MUKTASoft app or iFIX shall be directed to the eGov technical team.
