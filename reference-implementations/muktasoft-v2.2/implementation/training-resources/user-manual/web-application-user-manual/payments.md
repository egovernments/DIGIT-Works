# Payments

The Payments feature offers the following options to users:

1. [Search payment instruction](payments.md#payment-instruction)
2. [Create revised payment instruction](payments.md#create-revised-payment-instruction)
3. [Retry failed payment instructions](payments.md#retry-failed-payment-instruction)

All the payments are processed by the JIT-FS system which is a state treasury system integrated with MUKTASoft. These payments are processed from MUKTA funds and designated HOAs.&#x20;

On approval of bills, a payment instruction is created automatically and sent to the JIT-FS system.
