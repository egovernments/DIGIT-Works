# Schedule Of Rates

The fundamental rates for materials, labour, and machinery are determined by the State Public Works Department, establishing uniformity for a group of Urban Local Bodies (ULBs). However, the ultimate cost of Schedule of Rates (SORs) may vary from one ULB to another, contingent on the specific Conveyance and Royalty Charges applicable to each ULB.

The entire schedule of rates is divided into three interconnected registries for easy management and usage: SOR definition, SOR rate, and rate analysis.
