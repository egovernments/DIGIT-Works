## Workflows <a href="#workflow" id="workflow"></a>

### Creator <a href="#creator" id="creator"></a>

**Submit**

When a time extension request is created, it is submitted to the next user in the workflow for verification. Upon selecting the 'submit' action, the system provides the user with the option to either choose a specific user as the verifier or submit the request without selecting a verifier.

**Edit**

If a time extension request is sent back to the CBO for correction, the request is placed into the creator's inbox, allowing them to make edits. Simultaneously, the CBO has the ability to edit the request and subsequently re-submit it for verification.

### Verifier <a href="#verifier" id="verifier"></a>

**Verify and Forward**

The 'Verify and Forward' action enables the verifier to forward the time extension request to the approver after completing the verification process and adding the comments if required.
