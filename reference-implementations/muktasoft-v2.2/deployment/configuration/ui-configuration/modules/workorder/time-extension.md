# Time Extension

Work order is created for an approved estimate in order to award the work to CBO. CBO starts the work to complete it within a given time period.



In case organization comes to know that they are not in a position to complete the work within the given time frame due to various reasons, they need to inform the same to the officer in-charge of project and apply for time extension which is then subject to approval/ canceling of work order based on the analysis done by the ULB.\


Requests for time extension can be directly raised by CBO using the mobile application and by the officer in-charge of the project on behalf of CBO using web application. Once a request is raised it goes for verification and approval.
