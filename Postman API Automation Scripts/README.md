**Postman Automation Preparation Steps**

**Step 1: Define Your Automation Objectives**

Before you start with Postman automation, clearly define your objectives. Determine what you want to achieve through automation, such as regression testing, load testing, or continuous integration. Understanding your goals will guide your automation strategy

**Step 2: Organize Your API Requests**

**2.1. Collection Structure**
Create collections to group related API requests.
Use folders within collections to further organize requests.
Name collections and folders descriptively for easy identification.

**2.2. Request Naming Conventions**
Use meaningful names for API requests.
Include HTTP methods and endpoint paths in request names.

**Step 3: Environment Setup**

**3.1. Create Environments**
Set up environments for different environments (e.g., QA, production).
Define environment-specific variables for flexibility.

**3.2. Store Sensitive Data Securely**
Use Postman environment variables to store sensitive data like API keys and tokens.
Ensure your environment variables are protected and not exposed in scripts or exports.

**Step 4: Write Test Scripts**

**4.1. Pre-request Scripts**
Use pre-request scripts for dynamic data generation or setup.
Validate and manipulate request data before sending.

**4.2. Test Scripts**
Write test scripts to validate API responses.
Use assertions to check response status codes, headers, and JSON data.
Handle conditional logic based on test results.

**Step 5: Collection variables**

**5.1. Defining Collection Variables:**
To create a collection variable, open the collection you want to work with in the Postman app.
Click on the "Edit" button for the collection.
In the collection settings, go to the "Variables" tab.
Here, you can define variables by specifying a name, initial value, and description.

**5.2. Accessing Collection Variables:**
You can access collection variables in various parts of Postman:
In request URLs, headers, body, and scripts by using the {{variable_name}} syntax. For example, if you have a collection variable named base_url, you can use it in a request URL like {{base_url}}/endpoint.
In scripts (Pre-request Script and Tests) using the pm.variables.get("variable_name") method.

**5.3. Overriding Collection Variables:**
Collection variables can be overridden by environment variables. If you have an environment variable with the same name as a collection variable, the environment variable takes precedence when the request is executed.

**Step 6: Monitoring and Reporting**
Configure monitors to run collections at scheduled intervals.
Set up notifications for test failures.
Generate and review test reports for insights.
