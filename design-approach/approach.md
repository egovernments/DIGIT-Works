description: 'Works: Streamlining Civil Works Project Management'

# Approach

Works Management Systems are complex and challenging. While many agencies are building their products and solutions, these are independent systems that do not exchange data. This leads to inefficiencies in projects closely linked by nature, type, location, citizens etc.&#x20;

The Works Management solution seamlessly exchanges civil works/project-related information.

### Why Works Management System?

The Works Management solution facilitates the smooth flow of information related to projects, vendors, assets, attendance, estimates, contracts, and payments. Below are the key reasons for using Works solution.

1. **Streamlined Payments:** Integrates works and finance systems to speed up payments.
2. **Improved Coordination:** Enables collaboration between different agencies for better project management.
3. **Eliminates Duplication:** Shares open data and registries to avoid misuse of resources.

### Who Can Use It?

The platform is designed for diverse agencies, including national, sub-national, urban or rural local bodies, and para-statal organizations, to manage any type of civil project.

### How It Works?

The solution is a “shared source of truth” that all stakeholders can use to align resources and decisions to achieve operational and financial efficiency. It improves the transparency and competency of agencies executing Works.

Various departments in the government typically use a Works Management System (WMS) to track end to end lifecycle of a project (scope and finances).

### Features

* **End-to-End Project Tracking**: From scope definition to financial management.
* **Smart Payment Integration:** Links with iFIX for milestone tracking and simplified vendor payments.
* **Interoperability:** Uses registries and APIs to overcome siloed data challenges and enable seamless data sharing.

### Use Cases

The input to Works could be a decision that is taken in the legislature for the construction of new capital works or demand that is generated from within society or officers, for maintenance of existing projects.

`Examples:`

1. `Construction of new metro rail is of nature capital works (New Works)`
2. `Repair of existing roads is of nature operations and maintenance (O&M)`

Once the project is identified, the next step is estimating project costs. This is followed by tendering, contracting, sharing the work order with the contractor, tracking milestones, payments and closure.

### Workflows

The application design provides the capability to integrate smart payments with[ iFIX](http://ifix.digit.org/). The integration enables departments to track project milestones and simplify vendor payments. The multi-layer architecture design ensures transparency, visibility and fast decisions all of which translate to an accelerated pace of development. The registries and APIs ensure information flows seamlessly across channels removing the challenges of siloed data structures and facilitating interoperability.
