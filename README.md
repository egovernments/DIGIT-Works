# DIGIT Works

The DIGIT Works platform is an open-source Digital Public Good used by agencies and institutions to track project scope and finances. The objective is to facilitate transparency and efficiency of agencies involved in the execution of public works or civil projects. 

_Examples:_
_1. Construction of new metro rail (New Works)_
_2. Repair of existing roads (O&M)_

The platform is open, configurable and reusable, making it flexible to customise per project requirements. The goal of this works platform is to allow a seamless exchange of works-related information (such as projects, vendors, assets, attendance, estimates, contracts, bills etc.) between -
1. Works and finance systems to accelerate payments
2. Different agencies for better project coordination 
3. Share open data & registries to avoid duplication and misuse of resources
