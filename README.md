# Introducing Works

## About Works

The DIGIT Works solution is built as an open-source Digital Public Good to expand capabilities in public infrastructure. It is designed to work across boundaries at varying levels of capacity and complexity.

As per a recent article in Economic Times (2022), “_Capital investment outlay is being increased steeply by 33% to Rs 10 lakh crore. This will be 3.3% of GDP. Will be almost three times the outlay made in 2019”_

The majority of this capital investment (capital expenditure) which is on civil works is managed by offline or independent systems lying within the executing agencies. This is a massive problem as information is not exchanged between planning, executing, owning, financing, auditing and other authorities which leads to payment delays, poor quality of execution, poor financing and auditing amongst many other issues.
