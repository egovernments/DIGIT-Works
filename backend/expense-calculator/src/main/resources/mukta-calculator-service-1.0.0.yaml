  title: Mukta Billing Calculator
  description: >-
    Three types of bills are generated in Mukta - Wage, Purchase and
    Supervision. This spec covers APIs to calculate amounts for all three types
    of bills. The _estimate API will perform the same calculation as _calculate
    but will only return temporary results. _calculate calculates, stores
    mappings between the bill creating and bill entities,  persists the results
    and creates a bill.
