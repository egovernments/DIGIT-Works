# Muster Roll Service

This is a calculator service dependent on the Attendance service. Attendance logs basic attendance. Muster computes aggregates based on the attendance and business logic. Muster roll will have to be customised depending on the implementation. 

Technical documentation for this service is available [here](https://works.digit.org/platform/specifications/technical-specifications/low-level-design/services/attendance).
